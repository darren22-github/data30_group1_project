# Sparta Global Data 30 Group 1 Final Project

This project consists of a package that creates an ETL pipeline for the Sparta Global Academy.

The pipeline extracts the following data from an Amazon S3 data lake:

1. Academy Data - This has data on Spartans competency scores and the name of the trainer.

2. Talent Data - information on candidates invited to a Sparta Assessment Day

3. Sparta Day - This is data collected from the applicant that has made it to the Sparta Day event.
Applicants undertake psychometric tests and presentations and are scored on performance.

4. Applicants - This data on applicants who have applied to join a course with Sparta Global

Extracted Data from Amazon S3 is transformed within our program and then loaded into a SQL Database in order to be able to analyse the data.
